I have provided 2 archive file types because I was unsure of which one you wanted.  Both hold the same source code and structure however the .tar.gz is a tar archive within a gzip archive so there is an extra layer. (Im not familiar with .tar.gz filetypes but you seem to have requested it.  If this is not whats expected please let me know)

Make sure that the 'covid19_cases_polynomial_regression.py' file is in the same directory as the 'Data' folder.
The 'Data' folder must contain 'test.dat' and 'train.dat'.

You are going to need python installed. Im using 3.11.8.

You may also need to install the libraries used:
numpy
matplotlib
sklearn

Once this setup is complete we can run the python file.

To do this open a terminal at the directory with 'covid19_cases_polynomial_regression.py'.
Then run the command:
'python .\covid19_cases_polynomial_regression.py'

This will run the python program using python.
